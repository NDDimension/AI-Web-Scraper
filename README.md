# **Tutorial: 🔍 AI Web Scraper & Parser**

This project is a tool that helps you automatically visit a *website*, fetch its content, and then uses *Artificial Intelligence* (AI) to find and pull out **exactly** the specific information you are looking for from that content. It does this through a simple user interface where you provide the website address and describe the data you want.

## **🖼️ Demo Preview (Screenshot)**

## **🚀 Future Expansion: Build On Top!**
This project provides a solid, modular foundation for intelligent content extraction — but it's just the beginning. Want to expand it? Here are a few ideas:

- **🔄 Multi-page crawling:** Add logic to follow links and extract from multiple pages.

- **📄 Export formats:** Let users download results as CSV, JSON, or Markdown.

- **🧠 Structured parsing rules:** Allow predefined templates for common data types (e.g., product specs, blog summaries).

- **🌐 API access:** Wrap the app into an API so other tools can call it.

- **🧾 Document upload support:** Extend input sources beyond websites — like PDFs, DOCX, or pasted text.

- **🗃️ Storage & history:** Save previous results for comparison, tracking, or reuse.

The beauty of this architecture is its simplicity and flexibility. Each part (scraping, cleaning, chunking, parsing) is standalone — so you can swap in new models, plug in databases, or create entirely new user experiences without rewriting the core.

💡 Whether you're building a custom research assistant, price tracker, or legal document analyzer — this project is your launchpad.

## **🙌 Acknowledgements**
This project and guide were inspired by the excellent tutorial series by Tech With Tim. His breakdown of building an AI-powered web parser using Python and LLMs was incredibly helpful and shaped the foundation for this application.
